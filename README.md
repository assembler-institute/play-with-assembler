## Goals

- Improve your knowledge of JavaScript
- Learn and improve your knowledge in logic processes
- Improve your knowledge working with HTML, CSS and JS together.


## 1. Introduction

In this pill, you will develop several games with JavaScript to improve your skills and learn how to develop simple games with JavaScript and the browser.

## 2. Develop a game

This project must be developed in teams of 3 or 4 people. Each team should choose and develop one of the following games explained in the project documentation.

## 3. Requirements

- You must use only one HTML file to develop this game, this means that you must hide and show dynamic elements without reloading the page.
- Before starting the game, you must enter your username on the screen to start the game.
- The ranking of the players who have played a game
  - Must always be visible on screen
  - Refreshing the page will not lose the information stored in the ranking, since the information must be stored in localStorage.
  - When a player enters his username and clicks on the start button, the player must be added to the ranking with the message "Currently playing ..."
  - When this player finishes the game, the ranking will be dynamically updated to show your score instead of the previous message
- When the player finishes the game, the Scoring screen will be displayed with the results of the game.
- All game processes must be carried out without reloading the page
- You must store:
  - Current game
    - User name
    - Game duration
    - Scoring of the current game
  - Ranking
    - User name
    - Scoring
- The ranking will show above the last record that has been entered
- After each game the total score is stored (if you refresh the browser is lost)
- You cannot use third-party libraries
- You must use Git for the development of the project and branches for each feature, try not to separate branches by person

## 4. Deliverables

To evaluate the project you will need the following deliverables:

- Repository with the code that includes also the documentation bellow
- A presentation in Google Slides explaining:
  - Explain what lessons you’ve learned during this project
  - How have you decided to organize the three stages of the game that you have had to develop?
